# Household-Power_consumption-Forecasting
Our problem statement for this project is  “Household power consumption forecasting using deep neural networks". This project is based on time-series data analysis. The raw dataset contains seven features are: Global active power, Global reactive power, Voltage, Global intensity, Submerting1, Sub merting2, Sub merting3. We trained Encoder-Decoder LSTM, RNN and CNN models with the help of all seven features to predict Global active power for two and three weeks by giving as similar input data.
